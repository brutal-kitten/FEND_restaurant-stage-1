# Restaurant Reviews Project for Front-End Nanodegree Program @Udacity
---
At this project I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. I improved code in order to make application responsive for different sizes of displays, accessible for screen reader use. Also I've added the service worker that caches pages while online and shows them once there is no internet connection.    

### How to run?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
